# Accuracy Branch-Cap / Ambiguous-Candidate De-Risk — Measurement Study Design

**Status:** approved by user, ready for implementation plan.

## 0. Why this exists

The accuracy-offline-gate (`docs/projects/accuracy/specs/2026-07-13-accuracy-offline-gate-design.md`,
merged local `main` `1b9fdef`) ran Gate B for real over the full deduplicated 85-battle/944-decision
corpus at `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_BRANCH_CAP=4` (today's production default) and found a chosen-line
cap-hit rate of **12.9% (114/881), decisively above the gate's pinned 5% threshold — FAIL**
(`data/eval/accuracy-gate/gate-b-report.json`, `reports/2026-07-13-accuracy-offline-gate-verdict.md`).
That result is frozen and stays authoritative — this study does not recompute it.

`docs/ROADMAP.md`'s P0 item 6 (added when that verdict was recorded) opened two concrete follow-ups:

1. Compare `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_BRANCH_CAP ∈ {6, 8}` against the frozen cap=4 result, on the same
   corpus, same rules, both on cap-hit rate and real latency — before ever touching the 5% threshold
   or the production default.
2. Diagnose the 63/944 decisions Task 10's `_chosen_candidate` correctly excluded as
   ambiguous-`candidate_id` (a real, confirmed `decision.py` labeling gap) — root-cause them
   properly rather than let them quietly stay unexplained, and investigate whether a structural fix
   is feasible.

This document specs both, as one measurement study on **existing infrastructure** — no
`decision.py`/`evaluate.py`/`accuracy_gate_b.py`/`accuracy_gate_stats.py`/`accuracy_baseline_diff.py`
changes. A fallback-strategy redesign (replacing always-hit-on-cap with something less optimistic)
is explicitly **out of scope** for this spec — it requires new production logic, not a parameter
sweep, and is a separate, later slice.

## 1. Explicit non-goals (restated, not to be relitigated)

- **The cap=4 gate verdict is not recomputed.** `data/eval/accuracy-gate/gate-b-report.json`/`.md`
  remain the sole authoritative cap=4 result (114/881 = 12.9%, FAIL).
- No fallback-strategy (non-always-hit) implementation or comparison.
- No `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_MODE` default flip, no strength/winrate claim, no Depth-2 Stage 3 work.
- No change to the pinned 5% threshold, the bootstrap/Clopper-Pearson statistics, or the
  any-response/any-tie-order cap-hit rule.
- No production fix to `_label_ja`'s non-injective switch-slot labeling — this study diagnoses and
  reports feasibility only; the actual fix (if pursued) is a separate follow-up slice.
- No diagnostically-reconstructed telemetry is ever written back into the frozen cap=4 verdict or
  its artifacts.

## 2. Primary comparison — branch-cap sweep

### 2.1 Corpus and rule reuse

Same `room_raw_replay.py` extraction/dedup as every prior task in this lineage (Tasks 2/4/7/9/10/11
of the accuracy-offline-gate plan) — same manifest files, same `(seed_base, seed_index)` identity
key, same `G=85`. The frozen `data/eval/accuracy-gate/pre-refactor-baseline.jsonl` (accuracy-off,
cap-independent by construction — the off-path never consults `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_BRANCH_CAP` at
all) is read-only and cited by content hash, never re-run, never modified.

`accuracy_gate_b.py::run_gate_b` and `accuracy_gate_stats.py::verdict_for_cap_hit_rate` are used
**unmodified**. `accuracy_baseline_diff.py` is **also left unmodified**, but is *not* this study's
main comparator (see §2.4 — its `request_hash`-only pairing and `chosen_action OR score` regression
rule don't fit this study's needs; it may run at most as an optional legacy cross-check on its
original off-refactor use case). The only new code is new scripts under `showdown_bot/scripts/`
and a new eval module (`showdown_bot/src/showdown_bot/eval/accuracy_cap_derisk.py` or similar,
exact name decided during plan-writing) for the decision-key/comparator/diagnostic logic below.

### 2.2 `decision_id` — fixed now, one schema for every table

Confirmed against the current code (not deferred): `ExtractedDecision` already carries
`request_hash`, `log_prefix_hash`, `side`, `turn`, and `request.rqid`; the dedup layer's manifest
join already carries `seed_base`, `seed_index` per kept file. The canonical identity, fixed now,
used for every table in this study with no alternative schema:

```
decision_id = sha256(canonical_json([seed_base, seed_index, request_hash, log_prefix_hash, side, rqid, turn]))
```

**Before any table is used for anything:**
- Compute `decision_id` for all 944 extracted decisions and assert exactly 944 unique values —
  fail closed (raise) on any collision, do not proceed past this check.
- The frozen `pre-refactor-baseline.jsonl` predates this scheme and has no `decision_id` column —
  pairing it into this study's `decision_id` space is a **one-time enrichment**, not a repeated
  join: for each frozen baseline row, join on `request_hash` to find its candidate `decision_id`,
  then additionally cross-check `log_prefix_hash`, `side`, and `turn` against that same row before
  accepting the match (guards against a `request_hash` collision silently pairing the wrong
  decision). Zero matches or more than one match after this cross-check is fail-closed — raise, do
  not guess or drop.
- The frozen baseline file itself is never modified by this enrichment. The result is a new,
  derived, read-only mapping artifact stored under `data/eval/accuracy-cap-derisk/`
  (`decision-id-manifest.jsonl`, §4) — the frozen file's own directory stays untouched.

**Fail-closed pairing for every subsequent comparison**: before pairing any two tables
(off/cap4/cap6/cap8) by `decision_id`, assert every key expected in one table that should be in the
other actually is — a decision present in one table and silently absent from another is a
fail-closed error (raise, do not drop), not a silently-shrunk denominator. This mirrors the
fail-closed pattern already established in `room_raw_replay.py`'s `SeedIdentityConflictError` and
`accuracy_baseline_diff.py`'s request-hash collision guard (both from this same lineage).

### 2.3 Cap=4 auxiliary action-capture (+ latency) — validation-gated against the true eligible set, never a new verdict

The existing `gate-b-report.json` stores only the 20 rows where cap4-on differed from off — not a
full 944-row "chosen action per decision" table, which is needed to compute cap6-vs-cap4 and
cap8-vs-cap4 diffs. Closing this gap requires **one narrowly-scoped auxiliary run**, explicitly
distinguished from a new gate run, permitted for **both action-capture and latency measurement**:

- Named and tagged throughout code/artifacts as **`cap4_auxiliary`** (action-capture and latency
  variants) — never referred to as a new cap=4 gate run or verdict anywhere in code, comments, or
  reports.
- Action-capture produces one artifact: a full per-decision table for all 944 decisions at
  `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_BRANCH_CAP=4`, `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_MODE=1` (exact row shape in the next
  subsection) — modeled on `accuracy_baseline.py`'s existing `BaselineRow`/`freeze_baseline` shape
  as a pattern, not by calling that function directly, since it's hard-wired to the frozen off-path
  file and must stay untouched.
- Latency measurement (§2.6) may also include a fresh cap=4 pass on the real corpus, under the same
  `cap4_auxiliary` labeling discipline, for an apples-to-apples comparison with cap=6/8's latency
  figures.
- Both written **only** under `data/eval/accuracy-cap-derisk/` — never touch
  `data/eval/accuracy-gate/`.

**Why the historical 63 must be handled as their own eligible-vs-excluded split, not folded into one blanket check:**
`run_gate_b` calls `_chosen_candidate(on_trace)` *before* cap-hit and diff capture; for the 63
ambiguous decisions this raises and jumps straight to the exception path — those 63 decisions never
reliably entered either the 881-decision denominator or the stored 20 diff rows. The auxiliary
action-capture table, however, still gets a `chosen_action` for **all 944** decisions
(`heuristic_choose_for_request` itself always returns a valid `/choose` string — it's only the
*trace-based candidate/score resolution* that fails for the 63, not the action itself). This means
the validation gate below must be scoped precisely to the set the frozen 20 diffs were actually
computed over, not blindly to all 944:

- Define the historical **881-decision eligible set** as the 944 decisions minus the 63
  `request_hash`es stored in `gate-b-report.json`'s `acceptance.exceptions`.

**Hard validation gate, two-stage — raw byte-level reproduction first, semantic analysis second:**
the frozen 20 cap4-vs-off diffs were originally produced by the live `run_gate_b` code via raw
`off_action != on_action` string comparison — **not** via `normalize_choose`. A
`normalize_choose`-based comparison could legitimately fold some raw string differences into the
same canonical action, which would make a byte-perfect reproduction of the frozen run look,
incorrectly, like it produced fewer than 20 diffs. The validation is therefore explicitly two-stage,
never single-stage:

- **Stage 1 — raw reproduction gate (must pass exactly, on the 881 only):** compare the auxiliary
  table's raw, un-normalized `chosen_action` strings, keyed by `decision_id`, against the frozen
  baseline's raw actions (via the decision-id-manifest enrichment, §2.2). The set of `decision_id`s
  where raw strings differ, and the raw strings themselves, must **exactly** match the frozen
  report's 20 rows — same 20 IDs, same raw values, and the other 861 raw strings equal on both
  sides too. This stage does **not** use `compare_action_tables`/`normalize_choose` at all — it
  answers "is this new cap=4 auxiliary run the same run that produced the frozen result?", nothing
  more. **Any deviation here** (different count, different `decision_id` set, or a different raw
  string anywhere in the 881): STOP, do not proceed to cap6/cap8 comparison, root-cause before doing
  anything else.
- **Stage 2 — analytical action-diff metric (only after Stage 1 passes):** compute the
  `normalize_choose`-based `compare_action_tables` diff (§2.4) on the same 881 set. If Stage 1
  passed but the Stage-2 normalized diff set is *smaller* than 20, that is **not** a reproduction
  failure — it means some of the frozen 20 were pre-existing pure representational differences
  (e.g. equivalent `/choose` encodings that differ byte-for-byte but mean the same thing), and this
  gets reported honestly as such. Stage 2 answers "how many semantically distinct decisions are
  there?" and is the metric used throughout the rest of this study (§2.4 onward). If a score
  comparison is also done here, use `canonical_float` representation (reused from
  `accuracy_baseline.py`) or a pre-pinned numeric tolerance, decided before the run, not after
  seeing a mismatch, and only where §2.3's score-semantics rules (below) permit a comparison at all.

**The 63 historical exclusion cases are evaluated separately from both stages above, never folded
into either check.** Any action diffs (raw or normalized) newly visible among these 63 in the
auxiliary table are diagnostic bonus information (feeds §3.3), never a deviation from the
Stage-1/Stage-2 reproduction and never a backfill of the frozen verdict — report them, leave the
frozen gate completely unchanged.

Cap=6/8 must never be compared against a cap=4 auxiliary table that hasn't cleared both validation
stages.

**Row schema — resolution status, rank, and score are orthogonal, not one collapsed field:** a
candidate that only resolves after Tera-suffix stripping *and* lands at a non-zero rank are two
independent, simultaneously-possible facts about the same decision (Task 10's tera-overlay fix and
the `pick_best`-vs-`scored.sort` rank mismatch are separate mechanisms) — collapsing them into one
`score_resolution_status` enum would force a choice that loses one or the other. The row schema
keeps them orthogonal:

| field | required? | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `decision_id` | always | §2.2 |
| `chosen_action` | always | direct from `heuristic_choose_for_request`, stored as the raw string returned; canonicalized via `normalize_choose` only at comparison time (§2.4), never mutated in the stored row |
| `candidate_resolution_status` | always | exactly one of `exact`, `tera_stripped`, `ambiguous_label`, `chosen_missing`, `other_resolution_error` — **which** candidate (if any) structurally resolved, independent of its rank |
| `chosen_candidate_rank` | nullable | the resolved candidate's rank, when `candidate_resolution_status` resolved one at all |
| `chosen_rank_mismatch` | nullable | `true` when `chosen_candidate_rank != 0` — a resolved-but-not-rank-0 candidate (the known `pick_best`-vs-`scored.sort` mechanism); independent of `candidate_resolution_status` |
| `top_rank_score` | nullable, not "always" | the rank-0 candidate's score, when the trace has one at all — nullable so an empty or rank-corrupt trace never makes the whole row (and its `chosen_action`) disappear; only the score fields go null with the status still visible |
| `chosen_candidate_score` | nullable | only populated when `candidate_resolution_status` resolved a specific candidate |

**Action-diff validation (both validation stages above, and every cap-vs-cap/cap-vs-off comparison)
never fails or excludes a decision because of a missing `chosen_candidate_score` or `top_rank_score`**
— `chosen_action` is always present and is what action diffs are computed from. Score-based analyses
(§2.7) get their own, separately visible denominator per field (however many decisions have a
non-null `top_rank_score`/`chosen_candidate_score` at that cap), never silently reused as if either
covered all 944/881.

**Score semantics — frozen-off vs new cap tables, never blindly equated:** `pre-refactor-baseline.jsonl`'s
`score` field comes from the original Task-4 baseline chooser; its exact construction is verified
against the real `accuracy_baseline.py`/`freeze_baseline` code as a first implementation step, never
assumed to mean the same thing as this study's `top_rank_score`/`chosen_candidate_score` (which can
themselves diverge from each other under Tera-overlay or rank-mismatch). During the frozen-baseline
enrichment (§2.2), the legacy score is preserved verbatim as **`legacy_frozen_score`** on the
enriched row — never silently renamed into `top_rank_score` or any new-table field. Score deltas are
computed **only** when both compared fields have the same proven semantics:
- cap6-vs-cap4 / cap8-vs-cap4: `top_rank_score ↔ top_rank_score` is always comparable (same
  construction, same run family on both sides); `chosen_candidate_score ↔ chosen_candidate_score` is
  comparable only on the separately-visible resolvable denominator.
- off-vs-cap score comparisons: **skipped, or explicitly labeled incompatible**, unless the legacy
  chooser's score semantics are positively verified to match `top_rank_score`'s construction — never
  computed on an unproven assumption of equivalence.
- Action diffs (§2.4) are **completely independent** of all of the above — computed from
  `chosen_action` alone, continuing to cover all 944 decisions regardless of score-semantic
  compatibility.

### 2.4 Cross-cap and cross-mode action diffs — a new comparator, not `diff_against_baseline`

`accuracy_baseline_diff.py::diff_against_baseline` is not a fit for this study's main comparison,
confirmed by reading its current implementation: it pairs rows by bare `request_hash` only, flags a
`Regression` when `chosen_action` **or** `score` differs (conflating pure fidelity/EV score drift
under a different cap with an actual decision change — a real, expected, and uninteresting effect
this study must not miscount as a decision diff), and only carries `request_hash` in its output
rows. It stays **unmodified**, per §2.1, and may run at most as an additional legacy cross-check on
its original off-refactor use case — it is not this study's comparator.

Instead, the new eval module defines its own comparator:

```
compare_action_tables(reference_rows, candidate_rows) -> ActionTableDiff
```

with:
- Pairing exclusively via `decision_id` (§2.2), fail-closed on duplicate, missing, or extra IDs on
  either side (raise, never silently drop a row).
- `action_changed` computed **only** from `normalize_choose`-canonicalized `chosen_action` on both
  sides — never influenced by score. This is the Stage-2 metric §2.3 defines; a separate,
  raw-string-only comparison (no `compare_action_tables`, no `normalize_choose`) is used solely for
  §2.3's Stage-1 reproduction gate.
- Score change reported **separately**, as `score_delta`/`score_changed` fields, never folded into
  the action-diff counter — and **only computed when the two compared score fields have proven
  matching semantics** per §2.3's score-semantics rules: `top_rank_score ↔ top_rank_score` for any
  cap-vs-cap comparison; `chosen_candidate_score ↔ chosen_candidate_score` on its own separately
  visible resolvable denominator; `legacy_frozen_score` (the frozen off-path's preserved original
  score, §2.3) compared against a new-table field **only** if that comparison is positively verified
  compatible, otherwise the comparator **refuses or skips it explicitly** (`score_comparable: False`
  with a stated reason on the output row) rather than silently subtracting two differently-defined
  numbers.
- Correctly-named `reference_*`/`candidate_*` fields on every output row — not `baseline`/`replay`,
  which would misleadingly imply an off-vs-on relationship for a cap-vs-cap comparison.
- Explicit, named directions: `cap4 → cap6`, `cap4 → cap8`, `off → cap6`, `off → cap8` — the
  direction is part of the comparator's output/report labeling, never left implicit from argument
  order alone.

Four such diffs computed per cap-6/cap-8 pair: cap6-vs-cap4, cap6-vs-off, cap8-vs-cap4, cap8-vs-off
(the vs-off diffs are also available as a byproduct of each cap's own `run_gate_b` call — §2.5 —
and both sources should agree, a useful internal cross-check, not a required blocking gate).

### 2.5 Cap-hit verdicts — cap4 cited, cap6/8 freshly run, denominators always visible

- **Cap=4: cited only**, directly from `data/eval/accuracy-gate/gate-b-report.json` by content hash
  — 114/881 = 12.9%, FAIL. Never recomputed.
- **Cap=6, cap=8: each run once, fresh, on the full G=85/944-decision corpus** — full corpus, no
  sampling for this axis (matches spec §6 of the original gate design: full-corpus-only, no silent
  sub-sampling).
- Existing 5% threshold, game-clustered bootstrap (B=10,000, seed 20260713, per-game local
  decision-level rate — the Task-8-fixed version), zero-event Clopper-Pearson branch, and
  any-response/any-tie-order numerator rule: all reused **unchanged** via
  `verdict_for_cap_hit_rate`/`candidate_any_cap_hit`.
- **Per cap, report separately**: the number of ambiguous/unscorable (excluded) decisions at that
  cap, the resulting fully-paired denominator, and the resulting rate + CI/bound — never a bare
  cross-cap rate comparison without both denominators shown side by side. (Denominators may differ
  across caps if the ambiguous-candidate rate itself varies with cap — see Section 3.3.)

### 2.6 Latency — full-corpus-first, both trace modes, confound-controlled

Full 944-decision corpus for the latency axis too, for both `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_BRANCH_CAP ∈ {6, 8}`
(cap=4's latency figures are cited from the existing `2026-07-12-accuracy-slice-latency-gate.md`
single-board bench where directly comparable, and freshly measured on the real corpus alongside 6/8
for an apples-to-apples comparison — the existing report used one synthetic board, this study uses
real corpus boards). A short timing dry-run at the start estimates total runtime (the existing full
trace-based Gate B run took ~92s for one cap-comparison pass, making a full-corpus pass for both
trace modes × 2 new caps look tractable) — the dry-run informs planning, it does not by itself
trigger sampling; sampling only happens if the dry-run shows genuine infeasibility, and if it does,
it happens at the **game level** with a pre-pinned seed (drawing whole games, measuring every valid
decision within drawn games), explicitly labeled as a subsample in the report, never a silent
truncation.

**Confound controls, required:**
- Warm the persistent calc backend once, in a controlled fashion, before any timed measurement.
- Rotate/balance cap order per game or block deterministically — never always run 4→6→8 in the same
  sequence for every game, to avoid confounding cap effects with warm-up/ordering/backend-state
  effects.
- Trace-none (production-realistic, no `trace=` kwarg) and trace-enabled
  (`trace=DecisionTrace()`, what Gate B itself uses) are measured and reported **separately** — two
  independent latency series per cap, never merged.
- Report p50/p95/max **plus** the count of decisions actually measured and any exceptions
  encountered during the latency pass, for every series.

### 2.7 Report contents (per cap: 6, 8; cap=4 cited throughout as the reference row)

- Cap-hit numerator/denominator/rate + bootstrap-or-Clopper-Pearson detail + PASS/INCONCLUSIVE/FAIL.
- Decision diffs vs cap=4 and vs accuracy-off (both directions correctly labeled per §2.4, via
  `compare_action_tables`, not `diff_against_baseline`).
- Leaf-count/event-count distributions and the fraction of incomplete (`events_complete=False`)
  event lists — reported **with their own actual telemeterable denominator per cap**, never claimed
  to cover all 944 decisions. Ambiguous/excluded decisions at that cap contribute no telemetry to
  these distributions by construction (§2.3's `chosen_missing`/`ambiguous_label` resolution
  statuses) — the denominator must say so explicitly, not silently imply full coverage.
- Tera-diffs isolated as their own subset, not folded into the general diff count.
- Latency: p50/p95/max, trace-none and trace-enabled separately, per §2.6.
- No strength or winrate claim anywhere in this report — pure measurement, matching the existing
  gate's own framing, restated explicitly at the top of the report (same convention as
  `reports/2026-07-13-accuracy-offline-gate-verdict.md`'s boxed disclaimer).

## 3. Ambiguous-candidate diagnostic

### 3.1 Two-tier classification — exclusive primary cause, non-exclusive companion flags

A single "root cause" bucket per case loses real, co-occurring mechanisms (a score tie can
influence *which* colliding candidate becomes `best_ja` and what rank it lands at, without itself
*creating* the label collision that made resolution ambiguous in the first place — both can be true
of the same case). The classification is therefore two-tier:

**A. Primary resolution cause — exactly one per case:**

1. `label_collision` — at least two structurally different `JointAction`s render the same
   `_label_ja`/candidate-id string. Sub-typed, not assumed to be switch-only:
   `switch_target_omitted` (the confirmed dominant type from Task 10's investigation) plus whatever
   other collision types are actually observed during classification (do not force everything into
   the switch bucket without checking).
2. `chosen_candidate_missing` — the structurally-actual chosen `JointAction` is genuinely absent
   from the candidate set the trace considered at all (zero matches, not ≥2) — with a required
   sub-reason: top-K truncation, filtering, or some other loss. Checked via direct structural
   candidate comparison, not assumed to be co-equal in frequency with `label_collision` just because
   both are "ambiguity" — expected rare/absent for the historical 63 (already confirmed as ≥2-match
   cases), verified rather than assumed.
3. `invalid_or_nonreconstructable_request` — the request/state can't be consistently reconstructed
   during diagnostic replay.
4. `other_pipeline_error` — only when none of the above fit, with a mandatory concrete rationale per
   case (never a bare "other").

**B. Companion flags — zero or more per case, non-exclusive:**

`exact_score_tie`, `pick_best_vs_sorted_rank_mismatch`, `chosen_rank_nonzero`, `top_k_truncated`,
`multiple_structurally_equal_candidates`, `distinct_switch_targets_same_label`,
`distinct_tera_state_same_label`, `distinct_move_or_target_same_label`,
`candidate_absent_in_other_mode_top_k`, plus any further flags concretely observed and named during
classification (the list above is a floor, not a ceiling — do not force a newly-observed mechanism
into an existing flag if it's genuinely distinct).

This lets the report say, honestly, e.g. "Primary cause `label_collision/switch_target_omitted`;
also `exact_score_tie` and `pick_best_vs_sorted_rank_mismatch`" rather than losing a real, co-occurring
mechanism to a forced single-bucket rule.

### 3.2 Fix-feasibility — three variants evaluated separately, five questions answered explicitly

**Variant 1 — object identity within the same decision call.** Likely locally unique within one
`_choose_best` invocation, but not serializable and not stable across separate off/on runs (a fresh
`JointAction` object is constructed independently each call). Only viable as a short-lived internal
mapping, not a persisted key.

**Variant 2 — dataclass/object equality (`JointAction.__eq__`).** Investigate whether the existing
`__eq__` (if `JointAction` even defines one, vs. relying on default identity) actually covers every
semantically relevant field — switch target, move target, terastallize flag — before assuming
equality is a safe substitute for identity. Do not assume this without checking the actual
dataclass definition.

**Variant 3 — a stable structural candidate key (preferred long-term direction).** Either a
canonical serialization of every decision-relevant `JointAction` field, or a key assigned once at
enumeration time and carried through scoring/ranking/trace construction unchanged. Under this
variant, `_label_ja` reverts to being a purely human-readable display string, no longer
double-duty'd as a uniqueness-bearing identifier — which is the actual root defect this whole
ambiguity class stems from.

**Questions the diagnostic must answer explicitly, not leave implicit:**

1. Can `best_ja` be traced directly back to its originating `scored`/`items` entry within the same
   call, without going through `_label_ja` at all?
2. Does that traceability survive any copy/reconstruction across K-world sampling, single-world, and
   Depth-2 code paths, or is it lost somewhere in one of them?
3. Is a canonical structural key stable across accuracy off vs on (same `JointAction`, scored twice
   under different `SHOWDOWN_ACCURACY_MODE` states — must resolve to the same key both times)?
4. Which exact fields must the key include so that switch-target, move-target, and Tera variants
   never collide?
5. Could a future fix-slice generate the chosen candidate's telemetry directly, without raising
   `TOP_K_TRACE_CANDIDATES` globally (i.e., without changing the shared trace-population budget for
   every other consumer of `CandidateTrace`)?

This is an investigation and report, not a `decision.py` code change — implementing whichever
variant looks best is explicitly a separate, later fix-slice.

### 3.3 Scope: historical 63 (cap=4) plus the same diagnostic applied to cap=6/cap=8

The same classification code runs against every ambiguous/excluded case surfaced at **all three**
caps (the historical 63 at cap=4, and whatever set of cases cap=6/cap=8 produce during their own
Section 2.5 runs) — not hand-built once for the historical 63 and left unapplied elsewhere. Per
cap, report:

- Count of ambiguous cases.
- Overlap with the historical 63, by `decision_id` — which cases recur across caps, which are new,
  which disappeared (a case ambiguous at cap=4 might resolve cleanly at cap=6 if the underlying
  candidate set shifts, and vice versa; report this rather than assume stability across caps).
- Primary causes and companion flags per case, aggregated per cap.
- Conservative bounds (per §2.5, unchanged) — the ambiguous-case count already feeds directly into
  each cap's own reported denominator.

### 3.4 Non-contamination rule

No diagnostically-reconstructed telemetry (e.g., a manually-resolved "true" chosen candidate for an
ambiguous case) is ever written back into the frozen cap=4 verdict or its artifacts, or silently
folded into any cap's own headline cap-hit rate. A full sensitivity analysis (e.g., "what would the
rate be if all N ambiguous cases resolved to X") may be reported **separately and explicitly
labeled as a sensitivity analysis**, cleanly distinguished from the frozen gate result, following
the same pattern already used for the exclusion-bias-bound sentence in the original gate's closeout
report.

## 4. Deliverables / file layout

- `data/eval/accuracy-cap-derisk/` (new directory, everything from this study lives here):
  - `decision-id-manifest.jsonl` (§2.2 — the one-time frozen-baseline enrichment mapping)
  - `cap4-auxiliary-action-capture.jsonl` (§2.3, explicitly tagged, validation-gated against the
    881-eligible set)
  - `cap6-action-capture.jsonl`, `cap8-action-capture.jsonl` (§2.3's row shape, at cap=6/8)
  - `latency-results.json` (§2.6, all caps/trace-modes, including any `cap4_auxiliary` latency pass)
  - `cap6-report.json` / `cap6-report.md`, `cap8-report.json` / `cap8-report.md` (§2.5–2.7)
  - `ambiguous-candidate-diagnostic.json` / `.md` (§3, covering cap4/6/8)

  JSONL (not JSON) for every per-decision table, matching the frozen baseline's own convention and
  enabling straightforward row-wise provenance checking across all 944 rows.
- `reports/2026-07-13-accuracy-cap-derisk-verdict.md` (closeout, cites cap=4 from
  `data/eval/accuracy-gate/` by content hash, never duplicates or restates it as newly computed)
- `showdown_bot/scripts/` — new driver script(s) for the cap sweep and the diagnostic; exact
  script/module boundaries decided during plan-writing, following this codebase's established
  pattern of one focused script per distinct real-run responsibility (mirrors
  `run_accuracy_gate_b.py`/`render_accuracy_gate_reports.py`'s split).
- `data/eval/accuracy-gate/` — **read-only** for this entire study. Nothing in this directory is
  created, modified, or regenerated by any task in this plan.

## 5. Testing approach

TDD throughout, matching every prior task in this lineage: unit tests for `decision_id` uniqueness
assertion and fail-closed pairing (including the one-time frozen-baseline enrichment's zero/multiple
-match fail-closed cases), unit tests for `compare_action_tables`'s directionality and correct
`action_changed`/`score_changed` separation (§2.4) before it's relied on for cap-vs-cap comparisons,
a test proving the Stage-1/Stage-2 validation gate (§2.3) actually catches a deliberately-broken
raw reproduction (not just that it passes on real data) and correctly separates Stage-1 from Stage-2
from the 63's own diagnostic-only reporting, and unit tests for the two-tier classification scheme
against hand-built label-collision/missing-candidate/tie fixtures. Real-corpus runs (§2.5, §2.6,
§3.3) are integration checks with real numbers reported honestly, same discipline as the original
gate's Tasks 9–11.

**Additional required tests, from the row-schema/validation corrections above:**
- A fixture where a candidate resolves only via `tera_stripped` **and** simultaneously has
  `chosen_rank_mismatch=True` — asserts both facts survive independently in the row (neither
  clobbers the other under a single collapsed status field).
- An empty or rank-corrupt trace fixture — asserts the action row is still produced with
  `chosen_action` populated, `top_rank_score`/`chosen_candidate_score` both null, and
  `candidate_resolution_status` visibly reflecting the failure (not the whole decision silently
  disappearing from the table).
- A fixture where the raw Stage-1 reproduction is exactly the historical 20, but a synthetic
  normalization-equivalent string pair is included — asserts Stage-2's `compare_action_tables`
  does **not** count that pair as an `action_changed` diff, and that this is reported as a
  pre-existing representational difference, not a Stage-1 failure.
- A fixture with two score fields of unproven/incompatible semantics — asserts the score comparator
  refuses or explicitly skips the comparison (`score_comparable: False` + reason) rather than
  silently computing a delta across incompatible definitions.

## 6. Open items deferred to the implementation plan, not resolved here

- Exact script/module boundaries under `showdown_bot/scripts/` and the new eval module's file name.
- Whether `JointAction` already defines `__eq__` and what it covers (§3.2, Variant 2) — verified
  during implementation, not assumed here.
- Exact `canonical_json` serialization convention for `decision_id`'s hash input (e.g. key
  ordering/separator conventions) — pick one, pin it, and document it in the implementation, matching
  this project's `canonical_float` precedent for reproducible hashing.
